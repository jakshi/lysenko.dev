# Summary of important things that I did in 2020-2021 years
Due to piling up routine I got to writing 2020 year sum-up only in the end of 2021.  
So it will be both 2020 and 2021 years sum-up.

* One health issue solved.
* We travelled a lot in Thailand by car.
* I organized bunch of Bangkok's DevOps Fridays, created an interesting community of great engineers.
* We moved to a much better apartment (better for us and for kids) near a park :)
* covid-19 wasn't that bad in Thailand, but still there was a lot of sitting at home due to lockdown, curfews and restrictions.

# Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2019 years:

* **Arthi Jaganathan** - Principal Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services (AWS). I was amazed by Arthi sheer amount of knowledge in AWS and IT engineering and ability to learn new things. Something unknown? Let's do POC. Okay - it's known now :) I was really inspired to learn new things by her approach.

# New hobby this year:

* I realize that I really like to look at street art :)

# Two might-have-been dream in this year:

* I could sleep 8 hours per day - but I constantly find some excuses.
* I could walk 8000 steps every day - but I often find some excuses.

# What did not go well

* I didn't sleep enough in 2021 year, I should fix this as soon as possible.
* I didn't do much programming during 2021.
* I got my weight back to ~105 kg from <= 95 kg :'(
  * Mostly because I couldn't go out for a walk during covid-19 lockdowns.
  
# What went well

* Our daughter Lina was born, healthy and sound :)
  * So over 2020-2021 our son Ilya and daughter Lina are growing and bring us a lot of joy :)
* My wife's sister travelled to Thailand and stay with us for 8 months :)
  * She helped a lot with Lina.
* I went to several really interesting trainings about application security, DevOps and AWS.
* We moved to a new apartment near the park

  * Koh Chang
