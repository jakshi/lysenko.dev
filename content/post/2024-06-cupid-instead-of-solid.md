# CUPID instead of SOLID - get joy of programming back

Recently I found an interesting article about CUPID:

* C - Composable
* U - Unix Way
* P - Predictable
* I - Idiomatic
* D - Domain Based

And what's most interesting - it was about properties of code that make it good for fellow humans to read and understand.
