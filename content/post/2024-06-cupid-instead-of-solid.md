Worth reading - CUPIDâ€”for joyful coding: https://dannorth.net/cupid-for-joyful-coding/

Recently I found an interesting article about CUPID:

* C - Composable
* U - Unix Way
* P - Predictable
* I - Idiomatic
* D - Domain Based

And what's most fascinating - it is how to make code easy and comfortable for fellow humans to understand.
