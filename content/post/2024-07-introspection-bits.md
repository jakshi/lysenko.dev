I thought lately:

* That analysing your feelings and thoughts (especially negative one) - have its' own self worth - because, for example, you cannot be angry and analyse why at the same time. So irrespective of the outcome, you will be in a better state of mind.
* An interesting idea in the "the upside of irrationality" book - that humans are very good in adapting to changes, but greatly underestimate their ability to adapt. For some reason this idea help me to deal with procrastination. It makes it's easier to start something - because I tell myself - "You underestimate your ability to adapt - just start it - you will be fine" :)
* If you want to change something, if you start to change that something, some changes will be bad. And then over time you will come with a better outcome, state.
