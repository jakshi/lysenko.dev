# Review

Recently I read an interesting article on fake ransomware:

Fake ransomware gang targets U.S. orgs with empty data leak threats: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-ransomware-gang-targets-us-orgs-with-empty-data-leak-threats/

That was quite fascinating insight in social engineering in cyber crime world: that fake ransomware is quite widespread and popular.

Why work hard on hacking somebody servers if you can just claim that you stole the data and demand the ransom? :)

Surprisingly effective tactic.
So to say - lean approach in the world of ransomware gangs.
