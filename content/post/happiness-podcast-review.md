# Review

Recently I listened to an interesting TED talk:

https://www.ted.com/talks/the_ted_interview_design_your_life_for_happiness_with_elizabeth_dunn

That was quite interesting insight in happiness causes. It seems that we are wired to be happy when we share, when we give, when we help each other.

Other insights:

* people that buy time with money are usually happier
* people who donâ€™t use their smartphone during together meal are happier

One more brick to the happiness in life :)
