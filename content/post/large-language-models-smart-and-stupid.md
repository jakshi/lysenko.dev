# Review

Recently I listened to an interesting TED talk suggested by our CEO:

https://www.ted.com/talks/yejin_choi_why_ai_is_incredibly_smart_and_shockingly_stupid

That was quite interesting insight in strength and weaknesses of AI LLM like ChatGPT.

* AI LLM training models are huge but reasoning is still quite weak.
* AI LLM sustainability is an open question
* AI LLM think what next word to say, not what to say.
  * And that's why they hallucinate.
* Even before watching this talk I got impression of AI LLM as super/very hardworking and at the same time very low intelligence system.
* AI Scientist in a talk tells that we should work on more intelligent models, idea is replace quantity with quality have a lot of downsides.
* So AI LLM is not something to fear, it's something to stay and be useful. But we can do much better AI in future :)
