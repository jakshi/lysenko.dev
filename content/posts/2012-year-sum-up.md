* Two important things that I did this year: 
    * Went to big travel to Asia, living in Thailand during 2012/2013 winter.
    * Went for short travel to Greece and UAE. 

<!--more-->

* Most interesting/inspiring people I met this year:
    * Taxi driver Ali in UAE who can talk on 7 languages very good and knows about 15 languages not very well (but still can speak them)
* Two people that change my way to thinking this year:
    * Taxi driver Ali, I got that it's not so hard to know a lot of languages, you need just speak a lot.
    * Stephen Nelson Smith, He tought me a lot about IT infra management and software development.
* Two new hobbies this year:
    * Snorkeling
    * Bycicle riding
* Two might-have-been dream in this year:
    * Buy own apartment
    * Learn how to build sites with RoR

# What did not go well
I:

  * still have not much money so a lot of plans still postponed
  * often find hard to concentrate on work
  * still not very good in choosing priorities
  * spend a lot of time on garabage things, like reading blogs, news and so on useless stuff
  * don't pay enough attention to sport activity

# What went well
I:

  * traveled a lot, it was life changing experience!
  * was programming more, My developer skills became better, I learn basics of Python and some Ruby too.
  * finished statistics course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and got again that learning is fun.
