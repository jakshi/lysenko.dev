# What did not go well

I:

  * still have not much money so a lot of plans still postponed
  * often find hard to concentrate on work
  * still not very good in choosing priorities
  * spend a lot of time on garabage things, like reading blogs, news and so on useless stuff
  * don't pay enough attention to sport activity

# What went well

I:

  * learnt how to [drive a car](/img/me_and_a_car.jpg), I drove sedan, crossover, pick-up. In city, town, rural roads, highways.
  * traveled a lot, it was life changing experience! I traveled more than last year, because I can drive a car now. I was in several national parks in Krabi province and traveled by car to Penang island in Malaysia.
  * was programming more, My developer skills became better, I learnt basics of Python, Javascript and my Ruby is almost fluent already.
  * I learnt basics of CSS and HTML.
  * finished [Introduction to Finance course](https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and got that to learn good - you need to enjoy it, learning mood is important.
  * Enhance my [opscode chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) cooking skills even more.
  * learnt how to read ไทย, and now I know about 600 Thai words. Though I understand now that it's not a sprint - it's a marathon.
