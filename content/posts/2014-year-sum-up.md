* Most interesting/inspiring people I met this year:
    * Kaveh Mousavi Zamani - Software developer and DevOps engineer. He tought me that simplicity is a virtue for DevOps and complexity can kill your infrastructure projects.
    * Shuwn Yuan Tee - Software developer and DBA. She reminded me that you should never stop learning. It's amazing how much can people learn if he/she doesn't waste his/her time.
    * Dmitriy Paramonov - Entrepreneur. He showed me that it's more profitable to sell tools/supplies that help other people to do their work, than do that work by yourself.
* people that change my way to thinking this year:
    * Stephen Nelson-Smith - he tought me a lot about TDD. It changes my whole thinking about software development (in a good way). I understand that you can get confidence in your code.
* Two new hobbies this year:
    * Learning programming on [codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com)
    * Learn how to maintain and customizing my motorcycle
* Two might-have-been dream in this year:
    * Buy a car
