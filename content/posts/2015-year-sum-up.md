* 5 important things that I did this year: 
    * moved to **Malaysia, Cyberjaya** and lived there for a year.
    * bought a car and travel all around Kuala Lumpur (+- 300 km) on it.
    * found a better job, so I'm moving back to **Thailand, Bangkok**.
    * learnt more about **chef&ruby** and basics of **LISP** and **golang**.
    * started to read technical **books** again.

<!--more-->

* Most interesting/inspiring people I met this year:
    * **Torsten Förtsch** - Software developer and DBA from Germany. He tought me how to think about IT infra as architect. Several quotes from him: "if you want to be a good DBA you should think in sets" and "Me: Do you belive in power of TDD? Torsten: I believe in properly built architecture."
    * **Mahdi Sadrnezhaad** - He shows me how much one person can learn. And He tought me that reading books can be fun. so I'm reading books again! :)
    * **Sze Siong** - He shows me how motivated and productive should be mature DevOps engineer. Also I learnt a lot about TCP/IP networks from him.

* people that change my way to thinking this year:
    * **Torsten Förtsch**
        * I got more comprehensive view of IT infrastructure systems because of things that Torsten shows me. 
        * I saw what it means to be life-long engineer, and I would like to follow this path. 
    * **Jean-Yves Sireau**
        * I learnt from him how important for business is to make fast decision and make fast progress. What did it change in my way of thinking? I understand that I should become faster. Problem should be resolved fast. And solutions that brings fast results are better in general.

* Two new hobbies this year:
    * Reading books
    * Hiking

* Two might-have-been dream in this year:
    * make my eyesight better than last year.
    * visit Kota Kinabalu.

# What did not go well

I:

* made a big mistake and apply for elance job in addition to working full-time. It was an old client and she asked to finish some simple thing. Thing appears to be not really simple, and I screwed that elance project completely. what I learnt - I will avoid applying for job that requires more than 8 hours of works per day at all costs.
* I'm still strugling to have good regime and sleep enough and it hinders my productivity and efficiency.


# What went well

I:

* have better finances than last year.
* travel a lot, each months we went to a new place, Fraser's hills, Melaca, Port Dickson, Cameron Highlands, Langkawi, Thailand - Krabi, Singapore etc.
* I become much more reslient in bureaucracy battles, proccess a lot of documents that could be useful for further travelling.

# What I wanted to achieve last year and what happened?

* _I want to buy and learn to drive more powerful motorcycle, 50+ h.p._: 
  After I moved to Malaysia motorcycle would be a bad purchase. so I didn't do that.
* _I want to start programming RoR and/or javascript for money_: About JS. After a lot of experimentation with javascript I understand that I really enjoy writing backend, not frontend. So I decided to concentrate on learning DevOps, backend development and DBA skills. About RoR, I think that API+javascript frontend app model has better perspective than dynamically generated pages.
* _I want to have stable 50$ per hour rates_: Was sacrifised in favour of faster learning. I agree for lesser rates if I'm learning fast and have a lot of smart people around. Learning is the best investment for me.
* _I want to start speaking on a new language_: It appears to be hard to learn to speak on some language in a year if you don't spend all your time on that. I learnt Malay this year, and I learnt around 800 words and 50 phrases. But I cannot really speak with this vocabulary of course.
* _I want to visit 3 new foreign countries_: I visited one new country - Singapore. Could be more, but I concentrated on travelling inside Malaysia.
* _I want to start rock climbing again_: Was too lazy to do that.
* _I want to make my eyesight better than this year._: It didn't happen. I have some idea about how to do that, but need more money. That goal is moved to next year.

# What I would like to achieve in new year?

I want to:

* sleep 8 hours per day and walk&hike a lot
* fix my health problems 
* make my eyesight better than last year.
* travel to 3 new foreign countries.
* start programming on golang and lisp.
* have 50$ per hour rates
* learn ansible, salt and puppet.
* get more DBA skills at MySQL and PostgreSQL.
* start speaking on Thai language, even if it will be very simple talks.
