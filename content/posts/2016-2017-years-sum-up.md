For some reason I skipped 2016 year's sum-up, so I will write two years sum-up this year.

* 5 important things that I did at 2016/2017 years:
    * [+1 in our familty](/img/me_and_ilya.jpg), his name is Ilya.
    * In april 2016 I parted my ways with Binary.com and started to work with PropertyGuru Group in Bangkok, Thailand. Thank you for all the good time Binary.com! I learnt a lot during my work there.
    * I moved to DevOps Team Lead role.
    * Our family visited Ukraine, we weren't there for about 3 years.
    * Sold a car in Malaysia and [bought a new one](/img/me_and_my_car2.jpg) in Thailand.

* Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2016/2017 years:
    * Dan Podeanu - Leader, software developer with vast knowledge in systems. He was  a head of engineering in PropertyGuru Group for some time. Dan is proper engineering leader. Seeing IT systems as a whole, orchestrating enhancements of whole company engineering culture and IT infrastructure, care and inspire engineers who work with him, deep knowledge in IT systems, honesty and openness.
    * Pedro Pereira - Leader and software developer in PropertyGuru Group. There're a lot of good things about him, but most important thing that I saw - he really care about IT systems that we have. Now I know one of the most important criteria for hiring - hiring people who cares.
    * Jani Rautiainen - Leader and founder of PropertyGuru Group. I learnt from him importance of listening to people, and I saw how important it is to trust people. What a profound change these two things bring to company (engineering) culture!
    * Dmitriy Chekmarev - T-shaped software developer, who also good in DBA and systems. Never stop learning and be positive - those are two main things that I learnt from Dima.

# New hobby this year:

* Play with Ilya :)
* Reading IT related articles/books. I was especially impressed by [Site Realibility Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html) book.

# Two might-have-been dream in this year:

* I could sleep 8 hours per day - but I constantly find some excuses.
* I might speak Thai already, but I'm too lazy to practice Thai.

# What did not go well

* I didn't sleep enough 2016/2017 years, I should fix this as soon as possible.
* I didn't do much programming during 2016/2017.
* I procrastiante from big and important projects.
* I became overweight. So many tasty food here in Thailand.

# What went well

* Our sun Ilya is growing and bring us a lot of joy :)
* After I bought a car in Thailand, we travelled a lot around Bangkok. We visited Khao-Yai, Pattaya, Rayong, Koh Chang, Cha-am and Hua-Hin. Most of those places were visited several times.
* Our family travelled to Ukraine. I was very impressed by fully electical taxis (+ network of electic chargers) in Kharkiv. Coffee, food and coworking places were also fantastic.
* We rented our new apartment near PropertyGuru Bangkok's office, it was a fantastic decision (especially taking in account horrible Bangkok's traffic jams). And overall we have a better apartment than before.
* I was promoted to a DevOps Team Lead role, and I would like to become a good IT engineering leader.
* I had numerous business trips to Singapore (PropertyGuru Group HQ is in Singapore), as a consequece I fall in love with this city.
* I wrote a lot of Terraform code (mostly AWS specific), and I'm happy with my progress in terraform coding.
* I worked a lot with Salt (configuration management tool), and I really like my progress with it and code that I wrote.
* I visited DevOps Days in Singapore.
* I finially wrote this 2016/2017 sum-up and I'm very proud of myself :)
