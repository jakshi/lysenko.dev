Due to laziness I delayed sum-up for 2018 year till the middle of 2019, but here I'm.

Overall in 2018 was a very relaxed year.

* important things that I did at 2018 years:
    * One more [trip to Ukraine](/img/ukraine_in_june.jpg).
    * We travelled to the [North Thailand](/img/north_of_thailand.jpg) on our car.

* Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2018 years:
    * **Manav Kamboj** - Leader, CTO of PropertyGuru Group. His ability to coach and find an approach to people is magnificient. That's amazing how he can find potential and way to grow professionally in almost anybody. I learnt a lot about communication from him, and I would like to learn even more.
    * **Marek Tuchalski** - Leader and software developer in PropertyGuru Group. There're a lot of good things about him, but most impressive that he really cares about IT systems and he has enourmous engergy to bring changes to the better. I would like to learn how to be like that.

# New hobby this year:

* No new hobbies I guess.

# Two might-have-been dream in this year:

* I could sleep 8 hours per day - but I constantly find some excuses.
* I might speak Thai already, but I'm too lazy to practice Thai.

# What did not go well

* I didn't sleep enough in 2018 year, I should fix this as soon as possible.
* I didn't do much programming during 2018.
* I procrastiante from big and important projects.
* I still overweight. So many tasty food here in Thailand.

# What went well

* Our sun Ilya is growing and bring us a lot of joy :)
* After I bought a car in Thailand, we travelled a lot around Bangkok. We visited Chiang-Mai, Sukhothai, Pai, Doi Inthanon, Pitsanulok, Khao-Yai, Pattaya, Rayong, Koh Chang, Cha-am and Hua-Hin. Most of those places were visited several times.
* Our family travelled to Ukraine again.
* I had several business trips to Singapore (PropertyGuru Group HQ is in Singapore).
* I visited DevOps Days in Singapore.
* I finially wrote this 2018 sum-up and I'm very proud of myself :)
