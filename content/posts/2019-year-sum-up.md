# Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2019 years:

* **Pedro Pereira** - Technical leader, Head of Engineering in PropertyGuru Group. I would like to learn from him how to be a open, easy going person that unite, motivate and lead people to common goals. That's a leader that I would like to become.
* **Alexey Diomin** - Principal engineer in Agoda. Thanks to getting know him I saw that you can be good in programming, DevOps and system administration. You can dig deep to the Linux kernel and know your systems from perspecive of a software developer and DevOps engineer. That's an engineer and professional that I would like to become.
