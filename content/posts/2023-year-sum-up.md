# Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2023:

* **Dima Maleev**
    * Met him at Ukrainian IT Fridays. He is a Senior Engineering Manager at Agoda. Inspiration - what can you do if you dedicate a lot of effort. He made me think about building personal brand and things that person can achieve in IT world. He is the person who passed Google, Meta, Netflix and many others interviews. I would like to get to be there too. Also we had a lot of fun arguing about IT stuff.
* **Cong Nguyen**
    * He is an SRE Lead at Batdongsan (PropertyGuru Vietnam). I was really inspired by his deep knowledge of infrastructure and his ability to implement complex things fast and efficient. I would like to be able to do the same.

# New hobby this quarter:

* MacroPad building.

# Two might-have-been dream in this year:

* Fix my sleep pattern
    * I improved in sleep - but I still have long way to go
