# Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2024:
This year I met really a lot of interesting people. 
Mostly because my new workplace - Agoda has a lot of smart, talented and interesting people.
I could make this list much longer, but it wouldn't be practical, so I will limit it to 6 people.

* **Artavazd Balaian** - Senior Lead Software Engineer at Agoda.
    * I'm impressed by his ability to challenge the status quo and his ability to think outside the box.
* **Jamie Lennox** - Director of TPM at Agoda.
    * He connects people and be a force behind solving company wide problems. That's really inspiring.
* **Tzahi Hakikat** - Director Of Operations in Agoda
    * Always has unorthodox view on ideas and problems. Combined with deeply practical approach - I would like to be able to do the same.
* **Witchanon Umpriwan** - Staff SRE Engineer at Agoda
    * I'm impressed by his ability to dig into complex issues and find a solution really fast. I would like to be as fast as he is.
*  **Philipp Wiendl** - Senior DevOps Engineering Manager at Agoda
    * Great ability to organize and make everything simple and manageable.
    * I want to learn and improve my ability in those areas.
* **Jirapong Wattanatom** - SRE Team Lead at Agoda
    * He has a lot of cool skills to look up to.
    * And the most I'm impressed by his ability to care about team and prioritize what's important.

# New hobby this year:

* I started to cook more
  * A lot of simple food, like fried eggs, kashas, vegetable salads, cut fruits, baked chicken nuggets and so on.
  * I baked a Charlotte cake.
    * [Photos](#cooking-a-cake)
* Mindfulness practice

# Two might-have-been dream in this year:

* Achieve a full compliance with sleep and walk SLO
* Move to Australia
    * I tried to find a job in Australia, but it appears that it's very hard to find a job there if you are abroad.
* Apply for a Green Card
    * I was way too busy with my work for that, it was end of my trial period in Agoda, so I had to focus on work.
* I almost stopped drinking coffee for the first 8 months, but then I started to drink it again.
    * No coffee was a really good for me. Especially on sleep quality.
    * I need to find a way to get back to no coffee routine.

# What did not go well

* Electronic clutter started to grow again.
* I got laid off from my job at PropertyGuru.
    * PropertyGuru laid off all engineers in Bangkok office.
    * [Funny Picture](#job-search)

# What went well

* I managed to reduce my weight from 96 kg to 86 kg.
* I greatly improved my sleep pattern.
* I found a new job in Agoda as Lead SRE Engineer.
    * That a really great place to work and grow as a (SRE) engineer.
    * What's interesting that I got two job offers from Agoda and another company. I was impressed by me pulling that off.
    * In addition to being a great work place, Agoda has nice event for employees and their families. Like a Halloween party.

* I started to write code again.
    * Including exercises from Cracking the Coding Interview book.
* I found Sunday coding sessions meet-up
    * That contributed to my coding practice.
* I rearranged my "work from home" office room to have a better working place.
    * standing desk
    * split keyboard
    * [Photos](#office-work-from-home-setup-revamp)
* I read some books. 20 minutes of books reading every day. Books I read:
    * "Database Reliability Engineering: Designing and Operating Resilient Database Systems" by Laine Campbell and Charity Majors
    * "System Design Interview â€“ An insider's guide" by Alex Xu, Volumes 1 and 2
* We travelled:
    * Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur
        * Mainly to get new visas for Thailand.
        * In addition we also went to cool places for kids.
            * Kidzania - kids can try different professions there.
            * Super Park - kids can play there, trampoline, slides, climbing walls and more :)
        * [Photos](#malaysia-trip)
    * Thailand, Khao Kho
        * We visited "Amazing Dinosaurs" and Windmill farms.

        * Every year we see something new. This year there was a lot of information about rice and products from it.
        * [Photos](#korat-and-jim-thompson-farm)
* Mindfulness practice was a real game changer for me. I started to be much happier and more productive.
    * I use Headspace app for that.
    * I realize that being present here and now can make you much happier and more productive.
    * I noticed that I can be more calm and less anxious.
* Kids are growing
    * Kids are smart and cute
    * [Photos](#kids-are-growing)

* I do less doom scrolling now
    * I found it's effective to install apps that add delay to opening social media apps.
* I moved from emacs back to neovim.
    * Now my NeoVIM config is growing :D

## Job search story in 2024

* In February 2024 PropertyGuru laid off all engineers in Bangkok office.
* IT job market is very cold in 2024.
* I realized that sending CVs to companies is not effective.
    * Before I realized that I spent a lot of time optimizing my CV and sending it to companies.
* You need to contact people directly.
* So finding a job is now a full time job by itself.
* For me it wasn't very hard to pass the job interviews, but it was hard to get them.
    * I mean interviews were challenging and they ask hard questions.
    * At the same time I have about 20 years of experience in SysOps, DevOps, SRE.
    * So I can answer most of the questions.
* PropertyGuru lay off was a wake up call for me.
    * I live in Thailand on a work visa.
    * Any time I can be laid off. And my visa will be cancelled.
    * I need to settle somewhere, I cannot just be on a temporary visas all the time.
    * One of the options is to apply for a Green Card in the USA.
    * Another option is to move to Australia.
* Good parts of the job search - that I wanted to become better:
    * More coding and system design practice.
    * Mindfullness.
    * Experimenting and learning new things.
    * Better prioritization and time management.

# What I would like to achieve in 2025?
I want to:

* I want to reduce doom scrolling to less than 30 minutes per day.
    * Why? it steals my time and my motivation (due to dopamine depletion)
    * Doom scrolling is:
        * Facebook
        * Telegram
        * Twitter
        * Reddit
        * Google News
        * Netflix
    * I can control it through screen time log on my phone.
    * I can make it less attractive by adding delay to opening those apps.
        * Implemented on Facebook and Twitter.
    * I can make it less attractive by grayscaling those apps.
* I want to be mindful every day.
    * Why? it makes me happier and more productive.
    * That's hard to measure.
    * I can check my mood and what I'm worry about monthly.

        * I want to try monthly average, to incentivize me to do more than 8k steps on some days to compensate for less steps on other days.

    * find 3rd source of income.
    * fix my accounting, track and optimize my expenses.

    * Why? My lower back will thank me.
* I want to limit coffee to 1 cup per week.
    * Why? I will sleep better and my stomach will feel better.

# Retrospective on 2024 goals.
I wanted:

* I want to plan every coming day.
    * It appeared to be superfluous. Currently I think that instead of list of tasks you need list of priorities.
* sleep >= 7:30 hours per day for at least 20 days per month.
    * Get a better sleeping place for myself.
    * 5 months out of 12
    * Better than 2023, but still not enough.
    * That should be my priority in 2025 as sleep is a foundation of everything.
* Have my weight <= 90 kg.
    * Do at least 8000 steps every day
    * 2 months out of 12
    * I'll try 8k average steps every day, that should motivate me to do more than 8k steps on some days to compensate for less steps on other days.
* fix >= 2 of my health problems
* write code >= 3 days per week. programming language doesn't matter.
    * Finding sunday coding sessions was a great help.
    * I also do programming exercises from Cracking the Coding Interview book every weekend.
* earn 5000 USD per month after expenses.
    * I continue to invest in ETF fund(s)
    * I started to invest in provident fund.
* start speaking Thai, even if it will be very simple talks.
    * I'm in fully Thai team now, that helps :)
