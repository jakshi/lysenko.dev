# Most interesting/inspiring people I met during 2024:
This year I met really a lot of interesting people. 
Mostly because my new workplace - Agoda has a lot of smart, talented and interesting people.
I could make this list much longer, but it wouldn't be practical, so I will limit it to 6 people.

* **Artavazd Balaian** - Senior Lead Software Engineer at Agoda.
    * I'm impressed by his ability to challenge the status quo and his ability to think outside the box.
* **Jamie Lennox** - Director of TPM at Agoda.
    * He connects people and be a force behind solving company wide problems. That's really inspiring.
* **Tzahi Hakikat** - Director Of Operations in Agoda
    * Always has unorthodox view on ideas and problems. Combined with deeply practical approach - I would like to be able to do the same.
* **Witchanon Umpriwan** - Staff SRE Engineer at Agoda
    * I'm impressed by his ability to dig into complex issues and find a solution really fast. I would like to be as fast as he is.
*  **Philipp Wiendl** - Senior DevOps Engineering Manager at Agoda
    * Great ability to organize and make everything simple and manageable.
    * I want to learn and improve my ability in those areas.
* **Jirapong Wattanatom** - SRE Team Lead at Agoda
    * He has a lot of cool skills to look up to.
    * And the most I'm impressed by his ability to care about team and prioritize what's important.

# New hobby this year:

  * A lot of simple food, like fried eggs, kashas, vegetable salads, cut fruits, baked chicken nuggets and so on.
  * I baked a Charlotte cake.
    * [Photos](#cooking-a-cake)
* Mindfulness practice

# Two might-have-been dream in this year:

* Achieve a full compliance with sleep and walk SLO
* Move to Australia
    * I tried to find a job in Australia, but it appears that it's very hard to find a job there if you are abroad.
* Apply for a Green Card
    * I was way too busy with my work for that, it was end of my trial period in Agoda, so I had to focus on work.
* I almost stopped drinking coffee for the first 8 months, but then I started to drink it again.
    * No coffee was a really good for me. Especially on sleep quality.
    * I need to find a way to get back to no coffee routine.

# What did not go well

* Electronic clutter started to grow again.
* I got laid off from my job at PropertyGuru.
    * PropertyGuru laid off all engineers in Bangkok office.

# What went well

* I greatly improved my sleep pattern.
* I found a new job in Agoda as Lead SRE Engineer.
    * That a really great place to work and grow as a (SRE) engineer.
    * What's interesting that I got two job offers from Agoda and another company. I was impressed by me pulling that off.
    * In addition to being a great work place, Agoda has nice event for employees and their families. Like a Halloween party.

## Job search story in 2024

* That is a story with many turns.
* IT job market is very cold in 2024.
* I realized that sending CVs to companies is not effective.
* You need to contact people directly.
* So finding a job is now a full time job by itself.
* For me it wasn't very hard to pass the job interviews, but it was hard to get them.
    * I mean interviews were challenging and they ask hard questions.
    * At the same time I have about 20 years of experience in SysOps, DevOps, SRE.
    * So I can answer most of the questions.
* PropertyGuru lay off was a wake up call for me.
    * I live in Thailand on a work visa.
    * Any time I can be laid off. And my visa will be cancelled.
    * I need to settle somewhere, I cannot just be on a temporary visas all the time.
    * One of the options is to apply for a Green Card in the USA.
    * Another option is to move to Australia.
* Good parts of the job search - that I wanted to become better:
    * More coding and system design practice.
    * Mindfullness.
    * Experimenting and learning new things.

# What I would like to achieve in 2025?

* I want to be mindful every day.

  * Get a better sleeping place for myself.

* write code >= 3 days per week. programming language doesn't matter.
* earn 5000 USD per month after expenses.
