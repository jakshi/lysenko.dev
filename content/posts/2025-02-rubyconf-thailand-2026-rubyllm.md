At [RubyConf Thailand 2026](https://rubyconfth.com/) (Jan 31 - Feb 1), note 5 (final):

[RubyLLM](https://rubyllm.com/) - one Ruby API for 12+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama, Bedrock, and more).

What I like: the interactions are very Ruby-like - concise and readable. Chat, vision, audio, embeddings, tool calling, streaming - all through a uniform interface.

Also comes with a registry of 800+ models with pricing and capability info, so you can switch providers without rewriting code.
