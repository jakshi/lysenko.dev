Last weekend at [RubyConf Thailand 2026](https://rubyconfth.com/), note 1:

I'm a fan of Python's uv project, and now Ruby has something similar inspired by it:

rv - https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv

Why I like it:

* reduces mental load of working with Ruby tooling - it just works
* they plan to add uv's killer feature: embedded dependencies

Embedded dependencies matter for scripts in AI agent skills - when your script carries its own deps, skill becomes reliable. Also Ruby is concise, you can express a lot of logic in a few lines.

If rv implements embedded dependencies, it'll be a solid argument for using Ruby in AI agent skills scripting.

P.S. photos of us listening to presentation about rv :)
