At [RubyConf Thailand 2026](https://rubyconfth.com/) (Jan 31 - Feb 1), note 4:

[Typesense](https://typesense.org/) - an open-source search engine written in C++, easy-to-set-up, RAM-first engine optimized for instant "search-as-you-type" experiences. Seems good for e-commerce, websites, and SaaS application search. Not Ruby-specific - it was at RubyConf as a Rails integration workshop, but works with any language/framework.

On the workshop we ran a PostgreSQL + Typesense pair and experimented with search - both traditional and with LLM integration for natural language queries. With LLM you just ask in plain English instead of crafting query syntax.
