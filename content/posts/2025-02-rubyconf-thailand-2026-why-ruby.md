At [RubyConf Thailand 2026](https://rubyconfth.com/) (Jan 31 - Feb 1), note 3:

Why Ruby?

I asked many developers at the conference this question. The most common answer: even on large projects, the velocity of delivering features stays high.

My personal take - Ruby is a very concise and compact language. Yes, it's computationally expensive compared to Go or Rust. But in many cases shipping speed matters more than execution speed.

I tried to find a study comparing languages by feature delivery speed - couldn't find one. If you know of any, please share!
