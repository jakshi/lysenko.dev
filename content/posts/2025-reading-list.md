Continuing to reflect on articles and videos that I read and watched in recent years. Here is year 2025.

The year of AI/Claude (26 articles!) — Claude Skills, MCP, agents, and AI analysis dominated the reading list. Cloudflare incident analysis became a recurring theme (4 articles). Programming language debates emerged (Go, Rust, Python, C). Completed the full 3Blue1Brown "Essence of linear algebra" course. Python uv tooling continued from 2024. Total: 68 articles and videos.
