Watched an Interesting udemy course about useful mental models:  
[Make Better Decisions: 13 Mental Models for Team Managers](https://www.udemy.com/course/make-better-decisions-using-mental-models/)  
And my thoughts about it.

<!--more-->

Most interesting points from the course:
  * 7 words motto - What is your identity, touchstone for important decisions? And idea to shape it in 7 words.
  * Delegate like a trauma surgeon - story about situational awareness, that during the emergency somebody need to observe the whole situation.
    * really echoes with incident commander role in SRE (and firefighters)
  * Elon Mask (employee) vector theory - are your people work in the same direction and their effort combines (like vectors) or not?
    * actually you can apply that theory to a lot of things including your personal development :)
      * Is my personal development vectors add-up?
  * Execute quickly on reversible decisions and take time to analyze your options on irreversible, high impact decisions
